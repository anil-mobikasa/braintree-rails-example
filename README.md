Changes made to use TR (transparent redirect)
===============
1. Force the form url to use Braintree::TransparentRedirect.url

2. Force the form method to :post, as by default rails uses :put (hidden field) for updating resources, which will be rejected by Braintree's gateway in the TR scenario.

3. Added two actions accessbile through GET, as the TR's redirect_url

4. Some other very minor changes

braintree-rails-example
===============
[braintree-rails-example](https://github.com/lyang/braintree-rails-example) provides a demo rails application that uses [braintree-rails](https://github.com/lyang/braintree-rails) gem to interact with Braintree api.

It demonstrates how [braintree-rails](https://github.com/lyang/braintree-rails-example) simplifies the interaction with resources stored in Braintree's vault.

You can do most of the CRUD operations on the wrapped models just as if they are ActiveRecord.

The demo app has only one user model, with two columns, email and customer_id.

All other models, Customer, CreditCard, Address are stored in Braintree's vault.

Instructions
===============
Clone the repo

    git clone git://github.com/lyang/braintree-rails-example.git
    bundle install

Setup the database

    rake db:migrate

Then you need to edit config/braintree.rb to put in your Braintree sandbox credentials

    Braintree::Configuration.environment = :sandbox
    Braintree::Configuration.logger = Logger.new('log/braintree.log')

    Braintree::Configuration.merchant_id = ENV['MERCHANT_ID']
    Braintree::Configuration.public_key = ENV['PUBLIC_KEY']
    Braintree::Configuration.private_key = ENV['PRIVATE_KEY']

Then you can start the demo with

    rails s
